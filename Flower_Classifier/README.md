This is a Flower Classifier that runs on a Convolution Neural Network. The data used for training can be found on Kaggle using this link https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition . This Data classifies Flowers into 5 types: a)Daisy b)Dandelion c)Rose d)SunFlower e)Tulip . This dataset is a little small to get very good performance (Human Level), but using proper Data Augmentation 81% Accuracy on test-set was achieved. The JB notebook and Neural Network's weight are provided.
